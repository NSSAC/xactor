=================================================

XActor is a framework for doing distributed computing in Python,
using the actor model of programming.

Full documentation
------------------

The full documentation is available at ``docs/source/index.rst``

XActor depends on mpi4py which requires a MPI implementation
and compiler tools be installed on the system.

Installing Open MPI and mpi4py inside a conda environment
.........................................................

To create a new virtual environment with conda,
have Anaconda/Miniconda setup on your system.
Installation instructions for Anaconda can be found
`here <https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/>`_.
After installation of Anaconda/Miniconda
execute the following commands::

    $ conda create -n xactor -c conda-forge python=3 openmpi mpi4py

The above command creates a new conda environment called ``xactor``
with python, openmpi and mpi4py installed.

The following commands assume you are inside the above conda environment.
