    * At every timestep
        * Every actor
            * Computes for a random time period

* Allow sending large messages (split across multiple small ones)
* Post one IRecv per rank

* Compress the messages sent with lz4
* Pack messages directly (instead of pickling)
* Use IBcast when broadcasting
* Test Scatterv for sending to multiple nodes
